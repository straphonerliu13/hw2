            <p><em> <strong>Our mission:</strong> To create a new way of mental healthcare that puts the people first, so they can bekome their best selves.
            </em> </p>

            <p> Though invisible to the external world, our mental health lays the foundation of our overall wellbeing, and it is something we must care for and nurture with the right tools and relationships.</p>

            <p>bekome was founded on the realization that mental healthcare is something everyone needs, but not everyone gets. Globally, 70%+ of people needing mental healthcare do not seek or receive care, and for those receiving care, many are not receiving the right care that's tailored to or effective for them. Worse yet, even beginning the mental healthcare journey can be scary and overly complicated--there's so much information to navigate, and so many hurdles to jump through to secure a therapist--and for some, one bad experience or therapist relationship can lead to a major setback. 
                <p>bekome is here to simplify the process of accessing and receiving the <em>right</em> mental healthcare. </p>
